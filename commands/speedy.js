        __Attendance-related Commands__:
        The commands !absent and !present assume you have a start date and an end date (defaults to same as start date if not given)
        The basic format for both !absent and !present is this: 
        \t\t!command YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD 
        
        **absences**: See known absences.
        **absent**: Let us know you won't be raiding. (Example: !absent 2021-07-04)
        **present**: Cancel an absence. (Example: !present 2021-07-04)\n
