        __Remember: All commands start with a **!**__\n
        **adventure**: Want a real Adventure?
        **askspeedy**: Need a *guaranteed* helpful answer? Ask away.
        **cats**: Need a cat right now? Let's get one from the Internet...
        **dogs**: We've got 'em!  You can also use '!dog corgi' to get a corgi.
        **foxes**: How about a fox instead? To the Internet!
        **logs**: Want the link to the logs?
        **miniwheat**: Why not flip a mini-wheat?

        **strats**: Did you read the strat?

        __Attendance-related Commands__:
        **absences**: See known absences.
        **absent**: Let us know you won't be raiding. (Example: !absent 2021-07-04 Comment)
        **late**: Let us know you're running late. (Example: !late 2021-07-04 Comment)
        **ontime**: Cancels late. (Example: !ontime 2021-07-04)
        **present**: Cancel an absence. (Example: !present 2021-07-04)\n
        Some examples which work with either **absent**, **late**, **ontime**, or **present**:
        (N.B. Comments in !absent and !late can have spaces. Also, you can use commas or not, and you can use three-letter months or the whole word.)
        !absent July 4, 2021 (Absent on July 4, 2021)
        !absent Jul 6 2021 Jul 13 2021 (Absent from July 6 until July 13, 2021)
        !late July 4 2021 (Late on July 4, 2021)
        !ontime Jul 4, 2021 (On-time on July 4, 2021 -- removes the late for that date)
        !present July 4, 2021 (Present on July 4, 2021 -- removes an absence for just that date)
        !present Jul 6 2021 July 13 2021 (Present from July 6 until July 13, 2021 -- removes that range of absences)\n
