        Some of the commands (!strats, !xkcd) use the embeds feature to present things in a nicer way.
        
        If you can't see these, and you'd like to, do this:
        \`\`\`
        1. Open your settings via the gear at the bottom.
        2. Go to Text & Images
        3. Enable 'Link Preview.'\`\`\`
        If you don't want to do that, it's ok.  I've implemented a simple view of strats (!simplestrats), and 
        will work on a solution for xkcd.
