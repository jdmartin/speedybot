## attendance-related commands:
- The basic format for both !absent and !present is this: `!command start_date end_date`
- The format for the dates is Month Date (you can use three letter months, or the whole word, and single digit dates can have a zero before or not)
- The end_date is optional, and is set to the same as the start_date by default.
- Comments in !absent and !late can have spaces. Feel free to ramble.
- Commands:
  - !absences - See known absences.
  - !absent - Let us know you won't be raiding. (Example: !absent July 4 Comment)
  - !late - Let us know you'll be coming late. (Example: !late Jul 04 Comment)
  - !ontime - Cancels !late.
  - !present - Cancel an absence. (Example: !present Jul 4)
