Hello!  I can help by telling you stuff. 

Here are some things I can do (all commands start with a !. For example: !speedy):

adventure: Want a real Adventure?
logs: Want the link to the logs?
miniwheat: Why not flip a mini-wheat?
speedy: Displays this help message.
speedysource: View my source code.

Want something else? Ask Doolan.
